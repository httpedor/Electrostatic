# Electrostatic
## About

### **What is this repo?**
#### This is a simple basic electrostatic simulation, displaying field arrows, and simulating the attraction and repulsion of charges.
### **Why?**
#### I did this as a high school physics project, was really useful to explain to my classmates visually how basic electrodynamics works
### **How**
#### Just a simple physics formula:
$$
f_e = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{d^2}
$$
#### where
- $f_e$ = the force applied between the two objects
- $k$ = Coulomb's Constant
- $Q_1$ = First object's charge
- $Q_2$ = Second object's charge
- $d$ = Distance between the two objects

### **Build**
#### Just run "make" for the html build, and "make WIN32" for exe build

### **How to use**
#### There are a couple ways you can use this repo
#### You can just go to [link] and use it there
#### Or just download the release files on the release tab, and run main.exe
