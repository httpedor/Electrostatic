# Electrodynamics
## About

### **What is this repo?**
#### This is a simple basic electrodynamics simulation, displaying field arrows, and simulating the attraction and repulsion of charges.
### **Why?**
#### I did this as a high school physics project, was really useful to explain to my classmates visually how basic electrodynamics works
### **How**
#### Just a simple physics formula:
$$
f_e = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{d^2}
$$
#### where
- $f_e$ = the force applied between the two objects
- $k$ = Coulomb's Constant
- $Q_1$ = First object's charge
- $Q_2$ = Second object's charge
- $d$ = Distance between the two objects

### **How to use**
#### Just open the main.html file inside the 'out' folder

## Controls
- **Scroll** - Increases and decreases charge
- **C** - Adds a charged object
- **R** - Clears all charged objects
- **Right Click** - Removes a charged object
- **Left Click** - Moves charged object

## Todo
- [ ] Collision
- [ ] Win32 build in makefile (code is there, just need to add the recipe)
- [ ] Implement compute shader calculation in win32 version
